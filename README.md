## Description 
 I took a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. A user of the application can now view, add, edit, and delete categories, products and tags.

## Installation
Be sure to install necessary packages:

[dotenv, Express, Mysql2, Sequelize]
